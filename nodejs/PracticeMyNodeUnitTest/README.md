This is a repository to practice nodeunit. These instructions uses ["Unit testing in node.js"](http://caolan.org/posts/unit_testing_in_node_js/) page as a reference (thanks to a good journal!).

# Test cases
The test cases in this repository are constructed as below...

## Synchronous test cases (general unit test cases)
These examples of test cases are tagged by "test_synchronous_01" ~.

## Exception test cases
These examples of test cases are tagged by "test_exceptions_01" ~.

## Asynchronous test cases
These examples of test cases are tagged by "test_asynchronous_01" ~.

## Shared resources test cases
These examples are to have the risky experiences about when you use parameters that has wide scope.
These are tagged by "test_shared_resources_01" ~.

## Test cases with setUp and tearDown instructions
These examples are simplified by using setUp (that will be called before when every test cases are started) and tearDown (that will be called after when every test cases are finished).
These are tagged by "use_setup_teardown_01" ~.
